# shinyCellPlot

Demonstration of the CellPlot function for the simultaneous visualization of GO enrichment results and molecular data (e.g. log-fold-changes between two biological conditions of genes annotated under each GO term). The shiny app is actively running here:

I developed the cellplot function (and other plotting functions) as part of the CellPlot package:
